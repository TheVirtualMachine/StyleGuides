	\section{The Basics}
		\subsection{Organized Code}
			\subsubsection{Indenting}
				\paragraph{}
					Indent your code with tabs.
				\paragraph{}	
					If your editor/IDE does not let you indent with tabs, consider getting a better one! Eclipse is one good IDE that runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. You can install it on a (fast) USB stick if you want. It is also free/libre software.
				\paragraph{}
					https://www.eclipse.org/
			\subsubsection{Whitespace}
				\paragraph{}
					Generally, some whitespace is good, but too much whitespace is bad.
				\paragraph{}
					You should have an extra line:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item After field declarations.
						\item Before a new method.
						\item Between sections of code (put a line between your local variable declarations and the processing for example), although this is more of a guideline than a rule. Use your common sense!
					\end{itemize}
				\paragraph{}
					To see when you should have spaces in your code, see the exemplar below.
			\subsubsection{Comments}
				\paragraph{}
					Contrary to popular belief, you do \textbf{not} need to comment every other line of your code.
				\paragraph{}
					If you are using unfamiliar libraries, it may help you and others if you use more comments, but generally, lots of comments are not needed. There is nothing wrong with having extra comments, but they are rarely necessary. If you think that your code does not make any sense without comments, you should think if it can be written in a simpler way. If it cannot, then write some comments, but you will find that you can usually make your code a lot more KISS.
				\paragraph{}
					Again, this is a guideline, not a rule, but if you feel that you need comments \textbf{beyond} the Javadoc comments, then your code might not be KISS.

	\section{Javadoc}
		\paragraph{}
			Proper Javadoc style consists of Javadoc comments for all fields, classes, and methods.
		\paragraph{}
			Javadoc comments are designated with two asterisks after the slash. They go on top of the method, field, or class declaration that they are explaining.
		\begin{lstlisting}[style=javasnippet]
			/** This is a Javadoc comment for a field. */
			private int commentMe;
		\end{lstlisting}
		\begin{lstlisting}[style=javasnippet]
			/**
			 * This is a Javadoc comment for a method.
			 *
			 * @param num The number to square.
			 * @return The square of the number.
			 */
			private int square(int num) {
				return num * num;
			}
		\end{lstlisting}
		\begin{lstlisting}[style=javasnippet]
			/**
			 * This is a Javadoc comment for a class.
			 * 
			 * <h2>Course Info:</h2>
			 * ICS4U0 with Krasteva, V.
			 * 
			 * @version 17.02.24
			 * @author Vincent Macri
			 */
			public class MyClass {
				// Code
			}
		\end{lstlisting}
		\paragraph{}
			This allows the Javadoc generator to generate a webpage that explains everything easily. Modern IDEs will also pick up on your Javadoc comments, and remind you what the method, field, or class does when you hover your mouse over it.
		\paragraph{}
			There is one exception to the have a Javadoc comment for every method rule. If a method is overriding another method, and your changes are small enough that the Javadoc in the parent class still makes sense, you do not need a Javadoc comment. You should, however, use the @Override notation, to explicitly state that the method is being overridden. We do this because it does not make sense to write a comment for something that is already explained well in the parent class.
		\begin{lstlisting}[style=javasnippet]
			@Override
			public void overriddenMethod() {
				// Trivial code
			}
		\end{lstlisting}
